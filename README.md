**Mosaic Preview** is a QGIS plugin that allows you to preview drone imagery quickly using embedded GPS metadata (EXIF), without requiring full photogrammetric processing.

It is ideal for rapid inspection, visual validation of flights, and pre-analysis in agricultural, environmental, or infrastructure monitoring contexts.


## 🚀 Features

  - **Footprint geometries only** (vector rectangles based on EXIF GPS)
  - **Individually georeferenced images** (quick raster layers)
  - **Quick mosaic preview** (assembled and shown as a single raster layer)
